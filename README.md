Project Description

In today's competitive retail landscape, data is king. However, traditional POS systems often present data in a raw, unintuitive format that overwhelms busy shop owners. Shop GPT aims to democratize data analytics for small and medium-sized businesses, allowing them to leverage the power of AI without needing technical expertise.

This app will revolutionize how shop owners interact with their sales data. Instead of relying on spreadsheets and complex reports, they can simply ask questions as they would to a knowledgeable business analyst. Shop GPT will uncover valuable insights that might otherwise go unnoticed, empowering shop owners to make informed decisions that drive sales, improve customer experiences, and optimize their businesses.
